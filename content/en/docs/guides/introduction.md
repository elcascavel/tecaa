The **Understandable** principle is the third of the four principles of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
This principle follows Clear Web Content, which ensures that your web site has:<br>
**‚Ä¢	Readable Text;**<br>
**‚Ä¢	Predictable Navigation;**<br>
**‚Ä¢	Input Assistance.**<br><br>

## üìù Readable Text 
The text should be readable and understandable, with **clear meanings** for special or technical terms.<br><br>
üìå **Bad Example:**<br>
"Users should authenticate utilizing their designated credentials to access the portal."<br><br>
‚úÖ **Good Example:**<br>
"Log in with your username and password to access your account."<br><br>
### **Key Takeaways** for Readable Text:<br>
‚Ä¢	Use **plain language** (avoid complex words).<br>
‚Ä¢	Write **short sentences** and **break up large paragraphs**.<br>
‚Ä¢	Provide **definitions** for specialized terms when necessary.<br>

## üîÑ Predictable Navigation
Websites must be built in the same way and structure, so that users know what to expect.<br><br>
üìå **Bad Example:**<br>
‚Ä¢	The menu moves to a different position on different pages.<br>
‚Ä¢	The "Submit" button suddenly changes to "Go" on another page.<br>
‚Ä¢	A shopping cart icon unexpectedly redirects users to a homepage instead of the cart.<br><br>
‚úÖ **Good Example:**<br>
‚Ä¢	The navigation bar stays in the same place on every page.<br>
‚Ä¢	Buttons use consistent wording (e.g., always say "Submit" instead of switching to "Go").<br>
‚Ä¢	The search bar and menu options remain the same across pages.<br><br>
### **Key Takeaways** for Predictable Navigation:<br>
‚Ä¢	Keep the menu, buttons, and layout **consistent** across all pages.<br>
‚Ä¢	Ensure that **links** and **buttons** behave **as expected** (e.g., a shopping cart icon should always take users to their cart).<br>
‚Ä¢	Avoid **sudden changes** in design, wording, or navigation behavior.<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Input Assistance
Forms can guide users by giving them clear instructions and useful error messages if they input something incorrectly.<br><br>
üìå **Bad Example:**<br>
‚Ä¢	Before submission: The form does not tell users what format the password should be in.<br>
‚Ä¢	After submission: If there is an error, no message appears, leaving users confused.<br><br>
‚úÖ **Good Example:**<br>
‚Ä¢	Before submission: A form shows two password fields with a clear instruction:<br>
"Confirm your password by retyping it below."<br>
‚Ä¢	After submission (if they don‚Äôt match): The second field is highlighted with an error message:
"Passwords do not match. Please try again."<br><br>
### **Key Takeaways** for Input Assistance:<br>
‚Ä¢	Provide **clear instructions** before submission (e.g., password requirements).<br>
‚Ä¢	Show specific **error messages** when users make mistakes.<br>
‚Ä¢	Use **visual hints** (like highlighting the field) to indicate errors.<br>
‚Ä¢	Avoid generic errors like "Something went wrong", always **tell the user what needs to be fixed**.<br><br>
In summary, the understandable principle helps websites developers to create a more accessible experience for the user, enabling any individual, regardless of their abilities, to understand and utilize the digital content.
