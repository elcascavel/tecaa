The Understandable Principle includes:<br>
**•	Readable Text;**<br>
**•	Predictable Navigation;**<br>
**•	Input Help.**<br>
These tips help make websites easier for everyone to read and use.<br><br>

## 📝 Readable Text 
Text should be **easy to read** and understand. Special words should be explained.<br><br>
📌 **Bad Example:**<br>
"Users should authenticate utilizing their designated credentials to access the portal."<br><br>
✅ **Good Example:**<br>
"Log in with your username and password to access your account."<br><br>
### **Tips** for Readable Text:<br>
•	Use **simple words**.<br>
•	Keep sentences **short**.<br>
•	Explain hard or **special terms**.<br>

## 🔄 Predictable Navigation
Your website should work the same way on every page. This helps users know what to expect.<br><br>
📌 **Bad Example:**<br>
•	The menu changes position on different pages.<br>
•	Buttons always use the same words.<br>
•	The cart icon always goes to the cart.<br><br>
✅ **Good Example:**<br>
•	The menu stays in the same place.<br>
•	Buttons use consistent wording (e.g., always say "Submit" instead of switching to "Go").<br>
•	The search bar and menu options remain the same across pages.<br><br>
### **Tips** for Predictable Navigation:<br>
•	Keep menus, buttons, and layout **the same** on all pages.<br>
•	Make sure links and buttons do what users **expect**.<br>
•	**Don’t surprise users** by changing words or design.<br>

## 🛠️ Input Help
Forms should guide users. Tell them what to do before they submit. Show clear messages when something is wrong.<br><br>
📌 **Bad Example:**<br>
•	Before: The form doesn’t say what kind of password is needed.<br>
•	After: If there’s an error, the page shows nothing.<br><br>
✅ **Good Example:**<br>
•	Before: The form says, “Confirm your password by typing it again below.”<br>
•	After: If the passwords don’t match, it says: 
“Passwords do not match. Please try again.”<br><br>
### **Tips** for Input Help:<br>
•	Give **clear instructions** before users click “Submit.”<br>
•	Tell users what went wrong in a **helpful way**.<br>
•	Use **visual hints** (like highlighting the field) to indicate errors.<br>
•	Highlight problem areas (like using a **red box**).<br>
•	**Don’t say** just “Something went wrong.”<br><br>
**Summary**<br>
The Understandable Principle helps make websites easier for everyone to use. When websites are clear, consistent, and helpful, more people can enjoy them—no matter their ability.
