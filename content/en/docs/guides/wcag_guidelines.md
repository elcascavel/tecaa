The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a global standard for creating accessible web content. Applying these guidelines ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and applications.

This guide uses the **goal-metric approach** to help you plan and evaluate your implementation of WCAG in a structured and outcome-driven way.

## Make content perceivable to all users

Text alternatives for non-text content are available and descriptive.

**Steps:**
- Add `alt` attributes to images that convey meaning.  
- Use ARIA labels sparingly to provide semantic clarity where native HTML falls short.  
- Ensure video and audio content includes captions or transcripts.

✅ *Success is measured by assistive technologies accurately conveying visual and audio content.*

## Ensure all functionality is operable via keyboard

Users can navigate the interface without using a mouse.

**Steps:**
- Check keyboard tab order follows a logical flow.  
- Use focus styles to make it clear where the user is.  
- Avoid requiring gestures (e.g. drag-and-drop) without alternatives.

✅ *Test by navigating your app using only the keyboard and screen reader.*

## Make information and UI understandable

Content is clear, concise, and behaves predictably.

**Steps:**
- Use plain language and avoid jargon where possible.  
- Follow consistent layout patterns across pages.  
- Provide error suggestions and instructions when users make mistakes.

✅ *Success means users don’t need external help to understand and use the interface.*

## Make content robust and compatible with assistive tech

HTML and ARIA are semantically correct and validated.

**Steps:**
- Use native HTML elements whenever possible (`<button>`, `<nav>`, etc.).  
- Avoid misuse of ARIA roles and properties.  
- Validate your HTML using tools like the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/).

✅ *Success means your app works across browsers, platforms, and assistive technologies.*
