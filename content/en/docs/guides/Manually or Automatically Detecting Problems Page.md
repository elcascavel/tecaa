## Introduction

Making sure websites are easy to read is very important. Some people, especially those with learning or thinking difficulties, need clear and simple words to understand information online. To follow the rules from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), websites must be checked for how easy they are to understand. This can be done by people or with special tools.

## Checking If Content Is Easy to Understand (Manual)

Sometimes, people must test websites by hand because computers can’t catch everything. Humans can tell if something sounds confusing or hard to read.

### Ways People Test Websites
1. **Expert Review**
   - Experts check if the content follows WCAG rules.
   - They look for hard words and long, confusing sentences.

2. **User Testing**
   - Real users try the website, especially those with learning challenges.
   - Their feedback helps make the site easier to use.

3. **Readability Checks**
   - These make sure words are simple and easy.
   - Tools like Flesch-Kincaid scores tell how hard the text is to read.

### Helpful Tools for Manual Testing
- **Hemingway Editor**: Shows long sentences and hard words.

- **Browser Extensions**: Some browser tools can find hard-to-read text.

## Checking With Automatic Tools

Computers can also check if a website is easy to read. These tools are fast and good for checking big websites.

### Types of Automatic Tools
1. **Linter Tools**
   - Find code problems that affect accessibility.
   - Examples: **axe-core**, **Lighthouse**.

2. **Readability Tools**
   - Check how easy the text is.
   - Examples: **Readability Test Tool**, **Microsoft Word** readability.

3. **AI Tools**
   - Use smart tech to help make writing easier to understand.
   - Examples: **Grammarly**, **LanguageTool**.

### Limits of Automatic Tools
- They can’t understand all meanings.
- They can’t feel what a user feels.
- They work best with people also checking.

## Best Tips for Better Content
- Use both people and tools to test websites.
- Keep content up to date and easy to read.
- Use plain words and give simple versions when needed.
- Follow WCAG rules and make menus and pages work in expected ways.

## WCAG Compliance Levels

### **Level A**
- Avoid using hard or tricky words.
- Example: Don’t use short forms (like acronyms) without saying what they mean.

### **Level AA**
- Keep page layouts the same and give clear steps.
- Example: Explain strange or special words.

### **Level AAA**
- Use very easy words and give extra help.
- Example: Write short summaries for hard parts.

## Conclusion

Making content easy to understand helps everyone. Testing with people and tools can make sure your website follows the rules and is helpful for more users. If you check your content often, your website will be better for all kinds of visitors.
