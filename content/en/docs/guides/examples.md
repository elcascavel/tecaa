The **Understandable** principle helps make websites easier to read, navigate, and interact with for all users — especially those with disabilities or cognitive challenges.

Here are two real-world examples showing how this principle is followed well and where it can be improved:

---

## ✅ Good Example: [IKEA – ikea.com](https://www.ikea.com/)

IKEA’s website follows the Understandable principle in several ways:

- **Readable Text**: Uses simple, plain language and avoids technical jargon.
- **Predictable Navigation**: Menus are consistent across pages, and labels are clear and intuitive.
- **Input Assistance**: Forms for checkout and search include clear instructions, and errors are easy to understand and fix.

📌 **Why it works**:
> The design is minimal and content is clearly structured. Users with assistive technologies can navigate efficiently, and new users can understand the site without needing a guide.

## ❌ Bad Example: [European Parliament – europarl.europa.eu](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en)

Despite its importance, the European Parliament website has been criticized for lacking accessibility:

- **Overwhelming Layout**: Too much content on some pages, making it hard to follow.
- **Inconsistent Design**: Elements and menu layouts vary between pages, making navigation unpredictable.
- **Limited Input Guidance**: Forms lack clear instructions and error messages, making interaction harder for screen reader users and people with cognitive disabilities.

📌 **Why it fails**:
> A 2022 accessibility audit gave it a low score (55.8/100), citing poor navigation for screen readers and an inconsistent user experience across pages.

---

## 🧠 Why Examples Matter

Seeing good and bad implementations helps us better understand how small choices in design and language can significantly affect accessibility.

> The goal is not just to meet WCAG standards, but to create a genuinely inclusive and easy-to-use experience for all users.

## 👨‍💻 Tips for Developers & Designers

When working on your own project, consider the following to meet the Understandable principle:

- ✅ Use **plain language** whenever possible.
- ✅ Keep **navigation consistent** across all pages.
- ✅ Offer **clear labels and instructions** for all form inputs.
- ✅ Provide **specific and helpful error messages** (e.g., “Password must be at least 8 characters” instead of “Invalid input”).
- ✅ Add **contextual help** (e.g., tooltips or icons) when extra explanation is needed.
