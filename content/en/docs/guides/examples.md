The **Understandable** principle helps make websites easy to read, use, and interact with — especially for people with disabilities or learning challenges.

Let’s look at two real websites. One does an excellent job. The other has room for improvement.


---

## ✅ Good Example: [IKEA – ikea.com](https://www.ikea.com/)

IKEA’s website follows the Understandable principle in several ways:
-	**Clear Language**: The site uses simple words and avoids complex terms.
-	**Easy Navigation**: Menus look and work the same across all pages.
-	**Helpful Forms**: Search and checkout forms give clear instructions and show easy-to-understand error messages.

📌 **Why it works**:
> The design is clean, and the content is well-organized. People using screen readers or visiting the site for the first time can understand how it works without help.

## ❌ Bad Example: [European Parliament – europarl.europa.eu](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/portal/en)

Despite its importance, the European Parliament website does not follow the Understandable principle well. Here are the problems:
- **Too Much Content**: Some pages are crowded and hard to read.
- **Unclear Layout**: Menus and page designs change, making it hard to find things.
- **Poor Form Help**: Forms do not explain what to do. Error messages are not clear.

📌 **Why it fails**:
> A 2022 audit gave it a low score of 55.8 out of 100. It’s hard to use with a screen reader, and the design changes too much from page to page.

## 🧠 Why Examples Matter

Good and bad examples help us see how small design choices can make a big difference. The goal isn’t just to meet rules. It’s to make websites truly easy for everyone to use.

## 👨‍💻 Tips for Developers & Designers

When working on your own project, consider the following to meet the Understandable principle:

- ✅ Use plain, everyday language.
- ✅ Keep menus and layouts the same on each page.
- ✅ Add labels and tips to form fields.
- ✅ Write error messages that explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
- ✅ Use icons or tooltips when more help is needed.
